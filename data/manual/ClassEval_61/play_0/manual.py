### Method Description:
    def play(self):
        """
        Plays the current song in the playlist.
        :return: The current song in the playlist, or False if there is no current song.

        >>> musicPlayer.current_song = "song1"
        >>> musicPlayer.play()

### Solution Code:

        if self.playlist and self.current_song:
            return self.playlist[0]
        elif len(self.playlist):

### Source Code:
    def play(playlist):
        current_song = playlist[0]  # Assuming the current song is the first song in the playlist
        print("Now playing:", current_song)

### Predicted Code:
    def play(self):
        """
        Plays the current song in the playlist.
        :return: The current song in the playlist, or False if there is no current song.
