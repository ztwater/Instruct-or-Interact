### Method Description:
    def shuffle(self):
        """
        Shuffles the playlist.
        :return: True if the playlist was shuffled, False if the playlist was empty.
        >>> musicPlayer = MusicPlayer()
        >>> musicPlayer.playlist = ["song1", "song2"]
        >>> musicPlayer.shuffle()
        True

        """

### Solution Code:
    def shuffle(self):
        if self.playlist:
            import random
            random.shuffle(self.playlist)
            return True
        else:
            return False

### Source Code:
    def shuffle(playlist):
        random.shuffle(playlist)
        return playlist

### Predicted Code:
    def shuffle(self):
        """
        Shuffles the playlist.
        :return: True if the playlist was shuffled, False if the playlist was empty.
        """
        if len(self.playlist) == 0:
            return False
        else:
            random.shuffle(self.playlist)
            return True

### Adaptation:

### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted method `shuffle` in the context of the `MusicPlayer` class:

```
    def shuffle(self):
        """
        Shuffles the playlist.
        :return: True if the playlist was shuffled, False if the playlist was empty.
        """
        if len(self.playlist) == 0:
            return False
        else:
            random.shuffle(self.playlist)
            return True
```
