### Adaptation:
Total number: 44
### Raw Output:
To adapt the `condition_judge` method to the `FitnessTracker` class context, you can define the method within the class and use the instance variables `self.weight` and `self.height` instead of passing them as parameters. Here's the adapted method:

```python
class FitnessTracker:
    # ... (existing code)

    def condition_judge(self):
        """
        Judge the condition of the user based on the BMI standard.
        :return: 1 if the user is too fat, -1 if the user is too thin, 0 if the user is normal, int.
        """
        bmi = self.weight / (self.height ** 2)

        if self.sex == "male":
            male_std = self.BMI_std[0]["male"]
            if bmi < male_std[0]:
                return -1
            elif bmi >= male_std[0] and bmi < male_std[1]:
                return 0
            else:
                return 1
        elif self.sex == "female":
            female_std = self.BMI_std[1]["female"]
            if bmi < female_std[0]:
                return -1
            elif bmi >= female_std[0] and bmi < female_std[1]:
                return 0
            else:
                return 1
        else:
            return None
```

In this adapted method, we calculate the BMI using `self.weight` and `self.height`. We then determine the BMI category based on the sex by comparing the BMI value with the corresponding range in `self.BMI_std`. Finally, we return -1, 0, or 1 based on whether the user is too thin, normal, or too fat, respectively.

### Test Code:
class FitnessTrackerTestConditionJudge(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_condition_judge(self):
        fitnessTracker = FitnessTracker(1.8, 45, 20, "female")
        self.assertEqual(fitnessTracker.condition_judge(), -1)

    def test_condition_judge_2(self):
        fitnessTracker = FitnessTracker(1.72, 80, 22, "female")
        self.assertEqual(fitnessTracker.condition_judge(), 1)

    def test_condition_judge_3(self):
        fitnessTracker = FitnessTracker(1.72, 53, 22, "male")
        self.assertEqual(fitnessTracker.condition_judge(), -1)

    def test_condition_judge_4(self):
        fitnessTracker = FitnessTracker(1.72, 60, 22, "male")
        self.assertEqual(fitnessTracker.condition_judge(), 0)

    def test_condition_judge_5(self):
        fitnessTracker = FitnessTracker(1.72, 75, 22, "male")
        self.assertEqual(fitnessTracker.condition_judge(), 1)
