        """
        Recursively calculates the length of the palindromic substring based on a given center, difference value, and input string.
        :param center: The center of the palindromic substring, int.
        :param diff: The difference between the center and the current position, int.
        :param string: The string to be searched, str.
        :return: The length of the palindromic substring, int.

### Solution Code:

        if (center - diff == -1 or center + diff == len(string)
                or string[center - diff] != string[center + diff]):

### Source Code:
    def palindromic_length(center, diff, string):
        # Base case: if the center is out of bounds or the characters at the center and diff positions are not equal, return 0
        if center < 0 or center >= len(string) or string[center] != string[center + diff]:
            return 0
        
        # Recursive case: increment the length by 2 (since the palindromic substring includes the center and diff positions)
        # and recursively call the function with the updated center and diff values
        return 2 + palindromic_length(center - 1, diff + 1, string)
    

### Predicted Code:
    def palindromic_length(self, center, diff, string):

        if center < 0 or center >= len(string) or string[center] != string[center + diff]:
