### Method Description:
    def setNum(self):
        """
        Calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division.
        :return: the size of each block and the remainder of the division, tuple.
        >>> a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
        >>> a.setNum()
        (2, 0)

        """

### Solution Code:
    def setNum(self):
        size = len(self.lst) // self.limit
        remainder = len(self.lst) % self.limit
        return size, remainder

### Source Code:
    def setNum(num, divisor):
        size_of_each_block = num // divisor
        remainder = num % divisor
        return size_of_each_block, remainder

### Predicted Code:
    def setNum(self):
        """
        Calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division.
        :return: the size of each block and the remainder of the division, tuple.
        """
        num = len(self.lst)
        divisor = self.limit
        size_of_each_block = num // divisor
        remainder = num % divisor
        return size_of_each_block, remainder

### Adaptation:
Total number: 11
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted method `setNum` for the `AvgPartition` class:

```python
def setNum(self):
    """
    Calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division.
    :return: the size of each block and the remainder of the division, tuple.
    """
    num = len(self.lst)
    divisor = self.limit
    size_of_each_block = num // divisor
    remainder = num % divisor
    return size_of_each_block, remainder
```

### Test Code:
class AvgPartitionTestSetNum(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_setNum(self):
        a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
        self.assertEqual(a.setNum(), (2, 0))

    def test_setNum_2(self):
        a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
        self.assertEqual(a.setNum(), (2, 1))

    def test_setNum_3(self):
        a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
        self.assertEqual(a.setNum(), (1, 2))

    def test_setNum_4(self):
        a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4)
        self.assertEqual(a.setNum(), (1, 1))

    def test_setNum_5(self):
        a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)
        self.assertEqual(a.setNum(), (1, 0))
