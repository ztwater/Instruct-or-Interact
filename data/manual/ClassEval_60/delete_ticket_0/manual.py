### Method Description:
    def delete_ticket(self, ticket_id):
        """
        Deletes a ticket from the "tickets" table by ticket ID.
        :param ticket_id: int, the ID of the ticket to delete.

### Solution Code:

        self.cursor.execute('''
            DELETE FROM tickets WHERE id = ?
        ''', (ticket_id,))

        c.execute("DELETE FROM tickets WHERE ticket_id = ?", (ticket_id,))
    
        # Commit the changes and close the connection
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
