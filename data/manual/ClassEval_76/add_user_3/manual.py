### Adaptation:
Total number: 13
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted `add_user` method within the `SignInSystem` class:

```
class SignInSystem:  
    """
    This is a class as sigin in system, including adding users, signing in/out, checking sign-in status, and retrieving signed-in/not signed-in users.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the sign-in system.
        """
        self.users = {}


    def add_user(self, username):
        """
        Add a user to the sign-in system if the user wasn't in the self.users.
        And the initial state is False.
        :param username: str, the username to be added.
        :return: bool, True if the user is added successfully, False if the user already exists.
        >>> signInSystem.add_user("mike")
        True
        >>> signInSystem.add_user("mike")
        False
        """
        if username not in self.users:
            self.users[username] = False
            print(f"User {username} added successfully.")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"User {username} already exists in the system.")
            return False


    def sign_in(self, username):
        pass

    def check_sign_in(self, username):
        pass

    def all_signed_in(self):
        pass

    def all_not_signed_in(self):
        pass
```

In the adapted `add_user` method, I have added the logic to check if the user already exists in the `self.users` dictionary. If the user does not exist, the user is added to the dictionary with an initial state of `False`. If the user already exists, a message is printed indicating that the user already exists in the system. The method also returns `True` if the user is added successfully and `False` if the user already exists.

### Test Code:
class SignInSystemTestAddUser(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_user_1(self):
        signin_system = SignInSystem()
        result = signin_system.add_user("user1")
        self.assertTrue(result)

    def test_add_user_2(self):
        signin_system = SignInSystem()
        signin_system.add_user("user1")
        result = signin_system.add_user("user1")
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_add_user_3(self):
        signin_system = SignInSystem()
        result = signin_system.add_user("aaa")
        self.assertTrue(result)

    def test_add_user_4(self):
        signin_system = SignInSystem()
        result = signin_system.add_user("bbb")
        self.assertTrue(result)

    def test_add_user_5(self):
        signin_system = SignInSystem()
        result = signin_system.add_user("ccc")
        self.assertTrue(result)
