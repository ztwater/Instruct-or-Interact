### Adaptation:
Total number: 16
### Raw Output:
The adapted `solve` method for the `EightPuzzle` class would look like this:

```python
def solve(self):
    """
    Use BFS algorithm to find the path solution which makes the initial state to the goal method.
    Maintain a list as a queue, named as open_list, append the initial state.
    Always visit and pop the 0 index element, invoke get_possible_moves method find all the possible directions.
    Traversal the possible_moves list and invoke move method to get several new states.Then append them.
    redo the above steps until the open_list is empty or the state has changed to the goal state.
    :return path: list of str, the solution to the goal state.
    >>> eightPuzzle = EightPuzzle([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 0, 8]])
    >>> eightPuzzle.solve()
    ['right']
    """
    # Create a queue to store the states to be explored
    queue = deque()
    # Create a set to store the visited states
    visited = set()

    # Add the initial state to the queue
    queue.append((self.initial_state, []))

    while queue:
        state, path = queue.popleft()

        # Check if the current state is the goal state
        if state == self.goal_state:
            return path

        # Add the current state to the visited set
        visited.add(state)

        # Generate all possible next states from the current state
        next_states = self.get_possible_moves(state)

        for next_state in next_states:
            # Check if the next state has not been visited
            if next_state not in visited:
                # Add the next state and the path to reach it to the queue
                queue.append((next_state, path + [next_state]))

    # If no path is found, return None
    return None
```

This adapted `solve` method uses the `self.initial_state` and `self.goal_state` attributes of the `EightPuzzle` class, and the `get_possible_moves` method of the class to find the solution to the goal state. It maintains a queue and a set to store the states to be explored and the visited states respectively. It continues to explore the states until either the goal state is reached or no path is found.
