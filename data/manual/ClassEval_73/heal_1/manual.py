### Method Description:
    def heal(self):
        """
        Heal the character with 10 hp and the max hp is 100.
        :return: int, the current health points after healing.
        >>> player_1 = RPGCharacter('player 1', 93, 10, 3)
        >>> player_1.heal()
        100
        """

### Solution Code:
    def heal(self):
        self.hp += 10
        if self.hp > 100:
            self.hp = 100
        return self.hp

### Source Code:
    def heal(character):
        character['hp'] += 10
        if character['hp'] > 100:
            character['hp'] = 100

### Predicted Code:
    def heal(self):
        """
        Heal the character with 10 hp and the max hp is 100.
        :return: int, the current health points after healing.
        """
        self.hp += 10
        if self.hp > 100:
            self.hp = 100
        return self.hp
