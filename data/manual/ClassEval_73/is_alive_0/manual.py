### Method Description:
    def is_alive(self):
        """
        Check if player is alive.
        :return: True if the hp is larger than 0, or False otherwise.
        >>> player_1 = RPGCharacter('player 1', 100, 10, 3)
        >>> player_1.is_alive()
        True
        """

### Solution Code:
    def is_alive(self):
        return self.hp > 0

### Source Code:
    def is_alive(player):
        if player.health > 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

### Predicted Code:
    def is_alive(self):
        """
        Check if player is alive.
        :return: True if the hp is larger than 0, or False otherwise.
        """
        if self.hp > 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

### Adaptation:
Total number: 4
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted method `is_alive` for the `RPGCharacter` class:

```
class RPGCharacter:  
    """
    The class represents a role-playing game character, which allows to attack other characters, heal, gain experience, level up, and check if the character is alive.
    """

    def __init__(self, name, hp, attack_power, defense, level=1):
        """
        Initialize an RPG character object.
        :param name: str, the name of the character.
        :param hp: int, The health points of the character.
        :param attack_power: int, the attack power of the character.
        :param defense: int, the defense points of the character.
        :param level: int, the level of the character. Default is 1.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.hp = hp
        self.attack_power = attack_power
        self.defense = defense
        self.level = level
        self.exp = 0


    def attack(self, other_character):
        pass

    def heal(self):
        pass

    def gain_exp(self, amount):
        pass

    def level_up(self):
        pass

    def is_alive(self):
        """
        Check if player is alive.
        :return: True if the hp is larger than 0, or False otherwise.
        """
        if self.hp > 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Now, the `is_alive` method is added to the `RPGCharacter` class and performs the desired functionality of checking if the character is alive based on its health points (`hp`).

### Test Code:
class RPGCharacterTestIsAlive(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_is_alive_1(self):
        character = RPGCharacter("John", 100, 20, 10)
        self.assertTrue(character.is_alive())

    def test_is_alive_2(self):
        character = RPGCharacter("John", 0, 20, 10)
        self.assertFalse(character.is_alive())

    def test_is_alive_3(self):
        character = RPGCharacter("John", -10, 20, 10)
        self.assertFalse(character.is_alive())

    def test_is_alive_4(self):
        character = RPGCharacter("John", 1, 20, 10)
        self.assertTrue(character.is_alive())

    def test_is_alive_5(self):
        character = RPGCharacter("John", 10, 20, 10)
        self.assertTrue(character.is_alive())
