### Method Description:
    def attack(self, other_character):
        """
        Attack another character. The damage caused needs to offset the defense value.
        :param other_character: str, The character being attacked.

        >>> player_2 = RPGCharacter('player 2', 100, 7, 2)
        >>> player_1.attack(player_2)
        >>> player_2.hp
        92
        """

### Solution Code:
    def attack(self, other_character):
        damage = max(self.attack_power - other_character.defense, 1)
        other_character.hp -= damage

### Source Code:
    def attack(damage, defense):
        damage_caused = damage - defense
        return damage_caused

### Predicted Code:
    def attack(self, other_character):
        """
        Attack another character. The damage caused needs to offset the defense value.
        :param other_character: str, The character being attacked.
        """
        damage_caused = self.attack_power - other_character.defense
        other_character.hp -= damage_caused

### Raw Output:
