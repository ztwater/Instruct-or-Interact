### Method Description:
    @staticmethod
    def subtract(c1, c2):
        """
        Subtracts two complex numbers.
        :param c1: The first complex number,complex.
        :param c2: The second complex number,complex.
        :return: The difference of the two complex numbers,complex.
        >>> complexCalculator = ComplexCalculator()
        >>> complexCalculator.subtract(1+2j, 3+4j)
        (-2-2j)

        """

### Solution Code:
    @staticmethod
    def subtract(c1, c2):
        real = c1.real - c2.real
        imaginary = c1.imag - c2.imag
        return complex(real, imaginary)

### Source Code:
    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b

### Predicted Code:
    def subtract(c1, c2):
        """
        Subtracts two complex numbers.
        :param c1: The first complex number, complex.
        :param c2: The second complex number, complex.
        :return: The difference of the two complex numbers, complex.

        return c1 - c2


### Adaptation:
Total number: 7
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted method `subtract` in the context of the `ComplexCalculator` class:

```python
class ComplexCalculator:
    """
    This is a class that implements addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations for complex numbers.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def subtract(c1, c2):
        """
        Subtracts two complex numbers.
        :param c1: The first complex number, complex.
        :param c2: The second complex number, complex.
        :return: The difference of the two complex numbers, complex.
        """
        return c1 - c2

    def add(c1, c2):
        pass

    def multiply(c1, c2):
        pass

    def divide(c1, c2):
        pass
```

In the `ComplexCalculator` class, the `subtract` method has been added as a static method. It takes two complex numbers `c1` and `c2` as inputs and returns their difference `c1 - c2`.

### Test Code:
class ComplexCalculatorTestSubtract(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_subtract(self):
        complexCalculator = ComplexCalculator()
        self.assertEqual(complexCalculator.subtract(1+2j, 3+4j), (-2-2j))

    def test_subtract_2(self):
        complexCalculator = ComplexCalculator()
        self.assertEqual(complexCalculator.subtract(-1-2j, -3-4j), (2+2j))

    def test_subtract_3(self):
        complexCalculator = ComplexCalculator()
        self.assertEqual(complexCalculator.subtract(1-2j, 3-4j), (-2+2j))

    def test_subtract_4(self):
        complexCalculator = ComplexCalculator()
        self.assertEqual(complexCalculator.subtract(-1+2j, -3+4j), (2-2j))

    def test_subtract_5(self):
        complexCalculator = ComplexCalculator()
        self.assertEqual(complexCalculator.subtract(1+2j, 1+2j), (0+0j))
