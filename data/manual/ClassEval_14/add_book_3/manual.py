        Adds a book to the database with the specified title and author, 
        setting its availability to 1 as free to borrow.

```

This adapted method `add_book` adds a book to the database with the specified title and author, setting its availability to 1 as free to borrow. It uses the cursor to execute an SQL `INSERT` statement to insert the book details into the "books" table. The values for the title, author, and availability are passed as parameters to the `execute` method. After executing the statement, the changes are committed to the database.

### Test Code:
class BookManagementDBTestAddBook(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.db_name = "test.db"
        self.db = BookManagementDB(self.db_name)
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(self.db_name)
        self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()

    def test_add_book(self):
        title = "Introduction to Python"
        author = "John Smith"
        self.db.add_book(title, author)

        # Check if the book was added correctly
        self.cursor.execute("SELECT title, author, available FROM books WHERE id=1")
        result = self.cursor.fetchone()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        self.assertEqual(result[0], title)
        self.assertEqual(result[1], author)
        self.assertEqual(result[2], 1)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.db.connection.close()
        self.connection.close()
        # remove the test database file
        os.remove(self.db_name)
