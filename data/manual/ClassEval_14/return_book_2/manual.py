### Method Description:
    def return_book(self, book_id):
        """
        Marks a book as returned in the database based on the given book ID.
        :param book_id: int
        >>> book_db = BookManagementDB("test.db")
        >>> book_db.return_book(1)
        """

### Solution Code:
    def return_book(self, book_id):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            UPDATE books SET available = 1 WHERE id = ?
        ''', (book_id,))
        self.connection.commit()

### Source Code:
    def return_book(book_id):
        # Code to mark the book as returned in the database based on the given book ID
        # ...
        # ...
        # ...
        # Return a success message or any other desired output
        return "Book with ID {} has been marked as returned.".format(book_id)

### Predicted Code:
    def return_book(self, book_id):
        """
        Marks a book as returned in the database based on the given book ID.
        :param book_id: int

        return "Book with ID {} has been marked as returned.".format(book_id)

### Adaptation:
Total number: 5
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted method `return_book` in the `BookManagementDB` class:

```python

        Initializes the class by creating a database connection and cursor, 
        and creates the book table if it does not already exist
