### Method Description:
    def add_book(self, title, author):
        """
        Adds a book to the database with the specified title and author, 
        setting its availability to 1 as free to borrow.
        :param title: str, book title
        :param author: str, author name
        >>> book_db = BookManagementDB("test.db")
        >>> book_db.create_table()
        >>> book_db.add_book('book1', 'author')
        """

### Solution Code:
    def add_book(self, title, author):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            INSERT INTO books (title, author, available)
            VALUES (?, ?, 1)
        ''', (title, author))
        self.connection.commit()

### Source Code:
    def add_book(title, author):
        # Code to add the book to the database goes here
        pass

### Predicted Code:
    def add_book(self, title, author):
        """
        Adds a book to the database with the specified title and author, 
        setting its availability to 1 as free to borrow.
        :param title: str, book title
        :param author: str, author name
        >>> book_db = BookManagementDB("test.db")
        >>> book_db.create_table()
        >>> book_db.add_book('book1', 'author')
        """
        self.cursor.execute("INSERT INTO books (title, author, availability) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (title, author, 1))
        self.connection.commit()

### Adaptation:
Total number: 4
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted `add_book` method in the class context of `BookManagementDB`:

```python
def add_book(self, title, author):
    """
    Adds a book to the database with the specified title and author, 
    setting its availability to 1 as free to borrow.
    :param title: str, book title
    :param author: str, author name
    >>> book_db = BookManagementDB("test.db")
    >>> book_db.create_table()
    >>> book_db.add_book('book1', 'author')
    """
    self.cursor.execute("INSERT INTO books (title, author, availability) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (title, author, 1))
    self.connection.commit()
```

Please note that the adapted method includes the necessary database query to insert the book information into the `books` table, and commits the changes to the database.

### Test Code:
class BookManagementDBTestAddBook(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.db_name = "test.db"
        self.db = BookManagementDB(self.db_name)
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(self.db_name)
        self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()

    def test_add_book(self):
        title = "Introduction to Python"
        author = "John Smith"
        self.db.add_book(title, author)

        # Check if the book was added correctly
        self.cursor.execute("SELECT title, author, available FROM books WHERE id=1")
        result = self.cursor.fetchone()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        self.assertEqual(result[0], title)
        self.assertEqual(result[1], author)
        self.assertEqual(result[2], 1)

    def tearDown(self):
        self.db.connection.close()
        self.connection.close()
        # remove the test database file
        os.remove(self.db_name)

### Test Output:
# 2 errors, 0 failures in 1 runs.
# errors:
#     NameError:
#         test_add_book: name 'os' is not defined
#     sqlite3.OperationalError:
