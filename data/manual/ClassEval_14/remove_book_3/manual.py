### Method Description:
    def remove_book(self, book_id):
        """
        Removes a book from the database based on the given book ID.
        :param book_id: int
        >>> book_db = BookManagementDB("test.db")
        >>> book_db.remove_book(1)
        """

### Solution Code:
    def remove_book(self, book_id):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            DELETE FROM books WHERE id = ?
        ''', (book_id,))
        self.connection.commit()

### Source Code:

        # Code to remove the book from the database based on the book ID
        # ...
        # ...
        # ...
    

### Predicted Code:
    def remove_book(self, book_id):
        """
        Removes a book from the database based on the given book ID.
        :param book_id: int

        self.cursor.execute("DELETE FROM books WHERE book_id = ?", (book_id,))
        self.connection.commit()

### Adaptation:
Total number: 4
### Raw Output:
```
