### Method Description:
    def borrow_book(self, book_id):
        """
        Marks a book as borrowed in the database based on the given book ID.
        :param book_id: int
        >>> book_db = BookManagementDB("test.db")
        >>> book_db.borrow_book(1)
        """

### Solution Code:
    def borrow_book(self, book_id):
        self.cursor.execute('''
            UPDATE books SET available = 0 WHERE id = ?
        ''', (book_id,))

### Source Code:

        # ...
    
        # Update the book status to "borrowed" based on the given book ID

        # Commit the changes to the database
        # ...
    
        # Close the database connection
        # ...
    
        # Optionally, return a success message or any other relevant information
        # ...

### Predicted Code:
