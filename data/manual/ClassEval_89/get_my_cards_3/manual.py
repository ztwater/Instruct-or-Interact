### Method Description:
    def get_my_cards(self):
        """
        Get a list of four random numbers between 1 and 9 representing the player's cards.
        :return: list of integers, representing the player's cards
        >>> game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        >>> game.get_my_cards()

        """

### Solution Code:
    def get_my_cards(self):
        self.nums = []
        self._generate_cards()
        return self.nums

### Source Code:
    def get_my_cards():
        cards = []
        for _ in range(4):
            card = random.randint(1, 9)
            cards.append(card)
        return cards

### Predicted Code:
    def get_my_cards(self):
        """
        Get a list of four random numbers between 1 and 9 representing the player's cards.
        :return: list of integers, representing the player's cards
        >>> game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        >>> game.get_my_cards()
        """
        cards = []
        for _ in range(4):
            card = random.randint(1, 9)
            cards.append(card)
        return cards

### Adaptation:
Total number: 2
### Raw Output:
To adapt the `get_my_cards` method to the `TwentyFourPointGame` class context, you can update the method as follows:

```python
def get_my_cards(self):
    """
    Get a list of four random numbers between 1 and 9 representing the player's cards.
    :return: list of integers, representing the player's cards
    >>> game = TwentyFourPointGame()
    >>> game.get_my_cards()
    """
    cards = []
    for _ in range(4):
        card = random.randint(1, 9)
        cards.append(card)
    return cards
```

Make sure to include the `self` parameter in the method signature to indicate that it is a member method of the `TwentyFourPointGame` class.

### Test Code:
class TwentyFourPointGameTestAnswer(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_answer_1(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        cards = game.answer('pass')
        self.assertEqual(len(cards), 4)

    def test_answer_2(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        result = game.answer('4*3+6+6')
        self.assertTrue(result)

    def test_answer_3(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        result = game.answer('1+1+1+1')
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_answer_4(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        result = game.answer('1+')
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_answer_5(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        result = game.answer('abc')
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_answer_6(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        game.nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
        result = game.answer('1+1+1+2')
        self.assertFalse(result)

    def test_answer_7(self):
        game = TwentyFourPointGame()
        game.nums = [1, 1, 1, 1]
        result = game.answer('1+1+1+1+1')
        self.assertFalse(result)
