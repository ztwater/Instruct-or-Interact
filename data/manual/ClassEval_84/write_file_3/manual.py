### Method Description:
    def write_file(self, content):
        """
        Write content into the self.file_path file, and overwrite if the file has already existed.
        :param content: any content
        >>> textFileProcessor = TextFileProcessor('test.json')
        >>> textFileProcessor.write_file('Hello world!')
        >>> textFileProcessor.read_file()
        'Hello world!'
        """

### Solution Code:
    def write_file(self, content):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)

### Source Code:
    def write_file(self, content):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)

### Predicted Code:
    def write_file(self, content):
        """
        Write content into the self.file_path file, and overwrite if the file has already existed.
        :param content: any content
        """
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)

### Adaptation:
Total number: 1
### Raw Output:
Here is the adapted `write_file` method for the `TextFileProcessor` class:

```
import json

class TextFileProcessor:  
    """
    The class handles reading, writing, and processing text files. It can read the file as JSON, read the raw text, write content to the file, and process the file by removing non-alphabetic characters.
    """

    def __init__(self, file_path):
        """
        Initialize the file path.
        :param file_path: str
        """
        self.file_path = file_path


    def read_file_as_json(self):
        pass

    def read_file(self):
        pass

    def process_file(self):
        pass

    def write_file(self, content):
        """
        Write content into the self.file_path file, and overwrite if the file has already existed.
        :param content: any content
        """
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            file.write(content)
```

This adapted `write_file` method adds the required functionality to the `TextFileProcessor` class. It opens the file specified by `self.file_path` in write mode and writes the `content` to the file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

### Test Code:
