### Method Description:
    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        """
        Counts the total number of all possible arrangements by choosing at least 1 item and at most n items from n items.

        :return: int, the count of all arrangements.
        >>> ArrangementCalculator.count_all(4)
        64

### Solution Code:

    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

### Source Code:

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            total_count += nCr(n, i)

Explanation:
- The method `count_all` is adapted to the class `ArrangementCalculator` by making it a static method within the class.
- The `count_all` method calculates the total number of all possible arrangements by choosing at least 1 item and at most n items from n items.
- The method uses the `nCr` method to calculate the number of combinations for each possible number of items chosen.
- The `nCr` method calculates the number of combinations by choosing r items from n items using the formula nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!).
- The `factorial` method calculates the factorial of a given number n recursively.
- All three methods are static methods, as they don't rely on any instance variables or methods of the `ArrangementCalculator` class.

    def test_count_all_1(self):
        res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(4)
        self.assertEqual(res, 64)

    def test_count_all_2(self):
        res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(1)
        self.assertEqual(res, 1)

    def test_count_all_3(self):
        res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(2)
        self.assertEqual(res, 4)

    def test_count_all_4(self):
        res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(3)
        self.assertEqual(res, 15)

    def test_count_all_5(self):
        res = ArrangementCalculator.count_all(5)
        self.assertEqual(res, 325)
